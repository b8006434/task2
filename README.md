Toll system application for countries, that would utilize the current ANPR systems used worldwide.
This is an alpha release.

The way this would work: Have multiple APIs setup for inputs. Two of the inputs would be a motorway starting point camera location and a motorway leaving point camera location for
a given vehicle. This would then be saved into a database alongside the vehicle information. This would form the bills, where they can be paid or outstanding.
The application would allow for 2 different dashboards - one for a 'normal' driver user, and another one for a 'toll system operator' user, which would manage users and bills.
A driver user can sign up to use the application using the 'Sign Up' form. Then the logged in driver is able to change their stored information and save that in the database.
The driver can see their outstanding bills, able to pay their bills and see their travel history. The toll operator is able to see all signed up driver, and their bill history.
The system would send an email, when the bill becomes overdue. The toll operator would also be able to get a driver's bill history as a PDF file.
